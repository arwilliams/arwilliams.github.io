      <description>About me I am currently a software engineer developing localization algorithms for autonomous vehicles, and I am generally interested in developing mathematically principled approaches to estimation problems. My primary areas of expertise center around estimation and optimization on manfolds, and particularly on Lie groups.
I did my undergraduate and Master&amp;rsquo;s studies at CMU in the Department of Mathematical Sciences, and have been working in the software industry (primarily robotics) since.</description>
